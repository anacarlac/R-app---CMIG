## About the project
Worldwide, it can take up to 131 years to close the gender gap according to the World Economic Forum (2023). 
This number affects women's daily lives in different domains of their lives, from the time they spend in their household tasks to their increased risk for suffering different kinds of violence.
Thus, it is crucial to develop strategies to monitor these numbers and to develop strategies to close the gap.

To shed light into this initiative, the Brazilian gender gap data is presented in five categories:
    + Literacy levels
    + Career choices
    + Household tasks
    + Monthly income
    + Violence indices
